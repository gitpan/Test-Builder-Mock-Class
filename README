NAME
    Test::Builder::Mock::Class - Simulating other classes for Test::Builder

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::Builder::Mock::Class ':all';
      mock_class 'Net::FTP' => 'Net::FTP::Mock';
      my $mock_object = Net::FTP::Mock->new;

      # anonymous mocked class
      my $metamock = mock_anon_class 'Net::FTP';
      my $mock_object = $metamock->new_object;

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds support for standard Test::Builder framework
    (Test::Simple or Test::More) to Test::Mock::Class.

    Mock class can be used to create mock objects which can simulate the
    behavior of complex, real (non-mock) objects and are therefore useful
    when a real object is impractical or impossible to incorporate into a
    unit test.
